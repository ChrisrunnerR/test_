GIT: AS SOON AS you initialize a folder as a GitHub repository anything inside of it is going to 
be tracked by git, meaning you can add files and use git commands within this folder

Initialize a new git repository: 				git init 
If you want file/changes to NEXT commit:  			git add readMe.txt 
If you want to check what you have just done: 		git status
After you have staged you can commit with:			git commit -m "short desc. Of changes"
If you want to add everything in the repository:		git commit .
Want to create another branch copies current branch: 	git checkout -b newBranchName
Switch back to master branch 				git checkout master
